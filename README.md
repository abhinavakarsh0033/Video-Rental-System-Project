Video Rental System(VRS) helps people in renting/buying the movies they like to watch. The
system is an online video renting portal, which will be helpful not only for the customers to buy
or rent movies but also staff to maintain the inventory. Basically, the customer will sign up and
they can surf through various genres to find the movie they like to rent. Information about
various movies, their genres, Cast and crew and similar movies will also be displayed. The
customers can add the required movies to the cart, order and pay for the movies. The staff on
the other hand makes sure the movies on demand are being stocked up frequently and
customers do not cross the deadlines to return the movies back. Any inclusion of data science
here is welcomed.
The system should allow the following:
● Login by different entities (like Customer, Staff, Manager). Requires phone numbers
and mail Ids.
● The customers can surf through the list of movies sorted by the genres and see
details about movies, a short summary of the plot to give a little info about the movie.
A search bar can be provided to search movies based on keywords.
● Once the customer adds his movies to the cart and moves to buying/renting them,
the system needs to provide the combined cost or bill to the customer and after the
payment an invoice is always helpful. The number of pieces of movies which are
rented should automatically be decreased after renting/buying and be back after
returning them.
● Customer profiles need to show the previous order details with the dates by which
they have to return them.
● The staff keeps a check on the movies rented out and their respective duration.
They make sure that no customer has any dues. They also manage the inventory by
stocking up the movies. System can provide notifications to staff about the movies
which are currently absent in inventory.
● The manager overlooks over the inventory and has the sole power to remove any
movies, change their genres, perform audits over the sold and rented movies.
● Data science can be incorporated from recommending movies to customers by their
search history, purchase history and the current trends in purchases. They can also
predict the number of days after which we need to order movies to stock the
inventory based on the current rate of purchases saving time and improving
efficiency.
